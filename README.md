**Due Date:** February 23, 2025, 11:59 PM  
**Total Marks:** 100

## **Objective**

This project focuses on exploring and designing meaningful hierarchies of information. You will develop and refine layouts for a **desktop** and **mobile** experience using one AI incident from **P1**. Through this project, you will gain hands-on experience with creating type hierarchies, designing responsive layouts, and ensuring consistency across different screen sizes. 

The project is divided into three parts:
1. Generate and refine thumbnail sketches for both desktop and mobile layouts.
2. Digitally recreate and refine selected sketches in Figma, ensuring adherence to specific design constraints.
3. Finalize and present one desktop layout and one mobile layout, ensuring consistency and clarity in hierarchy and responsive design.

## **Instructions**

### **Part 1: Thumbnail Sketches**

1. **Select Content:**
   - Choose one AI incident from your **P1** data.
   - Include the following content in all designs:
     - **Title:** The title of the incident.
     - **Organization:** The organization(s) involved in the incident.
     - **Date:** The date of the incident.
     - **Summary:** A short description of the incident.
     - **Impact:** Key impacts or consequences of the incident.
     - **References:** A link to additional information.

2. **Generate Thumbnail Sketches:**
   - Create **25 thumbnail sketches for desktop layouts**.
   - Create **25 thumbnail sketches for mobile layouts**.
   - Sketches must:
     - Explore unique ideas (avoid small variations on the same concept).
     - Focus on:
       - Establishing a clear type hierarchy using text size and placement.
       - Composing layouts to direct the readerâ€™s attention.
       - Using space effectively to separate and emphasize key elements.

3. **Refine Selected Sketches:**
   - Choose **three desktop sketches** and **three mobile sketches** for refinement.
   - Refine these sketches by:
     - Clearly defining text placement and sizes (without requiring specific fonts or styles).
     - Using lines, boxes, or dividers to clarify hierarchy and composition.
     - Exploring high-contrast elements or grouping to direct focus.

### **Part 2: Digital Refinement in Figma**

1. **Set Up in Figma:**
   - Create a free **Figma Educational Account** using your SFU email.
   - Open a new design file for this project.

2. **Recreate Refined Sketches:**
   - Digitally recreate your **three desktop layouts** and **three mobile layouts** in Figma.
   - Apply the following constraints during this phase:
     - **Dimensions:** Desktop (1920px by 1080px), Mobile (390px by 670px).
     - **Colours:** 
       - **Black** (0, 0, 0, RGB)
       - **White** (255, 255, 255, RGB)
       - **Light Gray** (211, 211, 211, RGB)
       - **Dark Gray** (64, 64, 64, RGB)
       - **Accent Colour:** Choose one custom accent colour to complement the grayscale palette.
     - **Fonts:** Use only **FiraGO**, **Fira Sans Light**, or **Open Sans**.
   - Ensure that layouts remain cohesive and visually balanced across desktop and mobile.

3. **Iterate and Integrate Feedback:**
   - Present your digital designs during lab sessions for feedback.
   - Revise and improve your designs based on the feedback received.

### **Part 3: Finalize and Present**

1. **Finalize Designs:**
   - Select **one desktop layout** and **one mobile layout** for final submission.
   - Ensure the following:
     - Hierarchies of information are consistent across both layouts.
     - Visual language (e.g., typography, colour, spacing) is cohesive.
     - No information is lost in transitioning between desktop and mobile versions.

2. **Enhance Responsiveness:**
   - Verify that content scales appropriately between desktop and mobile layouts while maintaining readability.
   - Optimize spacing and proportions for both screen sizes.

3. **Organize Your Figma File:**
   - Collect all project materials into one organized Figma file.
   - Use headings, frames, and text notes to ensure clear navigation through sketches, refined designs, and final layouts.

4. **Write a Brief Design Explanation:**
   - Include a 150-word explanation in your Figma file addressing:
     - How you established a clear type hierarchy.
     - How the composition guides the reader through the content.
     - How space is used effectively to separate elements and direct attention.

5. **Deploy to GitHub Pages:**
   - Publish your final desktop and mobile layouts on GitHub Pages as part of your personal website.
   - Add a **Project 2** section to your website, linking to your Figma file and showcasing the final designs.

## **Submission Instructions**

1. **Submit to GitHub Pages:**
   - Ensure your final desktop and mobile layouts are live on GitHub Pages.
   - Add links to the final designs and Figma file in a **Project 2** section on your personal website.

2. **Submit on Canvas:**
   - Provide the link to your **Project 2** page (hosted on GitHub Pages) on the **Project 2 Submission** page on Canvas.
