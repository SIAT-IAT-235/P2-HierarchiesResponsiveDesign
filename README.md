# **Project 2: Exploring Hierarchies and Responsive Design (Three Weeks)**

**Due Date:** February 23, 2025, 11:59 PM  
**Total Marks:** 100  

---

## **Objective**

This project focuses on **exploring and designing meaningful hierarchies of information** while developing layouts for **both desktop and mobile experiences**. Using an AI incident from **P1**, you will refine type hierarchies, and structure layouts responsively, and ensure consistency across different screen sizes.  

However, **for the final implementation (coding & deployment), you will only develop either the desktop or mobile version—NOT both.** 

The project is divided into three phases:  
1. **Thumbnail Sketching:** Generate and refine layout ideas for both desktop and mobile.  
2. **Digital Refinement:** Develop structured layouts in Figma following design constraints.  
3. **Final Implementation & Presentation:** Choose **either desktop or mobile** for coding and deploy it on GitHub Pages.

## **Instructions**

### **Part 1: Thumbnail Sketches (Week 1)**

1. **Select Content:**  
   - Use **one AI incident** from your **P1** dataset.  
   - Ensure all designs contain:  
     - **Title:** Incident title.  
     - **Organization:** Organizations involved.  
     - **Date:** Incident date.  
     - **Summary:** Short description.  
     - **Impact:** Key impacts or consequences.  
     - **References:** Link to additional information.  

2. **Generate Thumbnail Sketches:**  
   - Create **25 thumbnail sketches for desktop layouts**.  
   - Create **25 thumbnail sketches for mobile layouts**.  
   - Sketches must:  
     - Explore different layout ideas (not minor variations of the same concept).  
     - Emphasize **type hierarchy, readability, and layout composition**.  
     - Effectively use **spacing and grouping** to organize information. 

3. **Refine Selected Sketches:**  
   - Choose **three desktop sketches** and **three mobile sketches** for further refinement.  
   - Enhance these sketches by:  
     - Defining **text placement and relative sizes**.  
     - Adding **lines, boxes, or grouping techniques** to improve clarity.  
     - Exploring **contrast and whitespace** to emphasize hierarchy.

### **Part 2: Digital Refinement in Figma (Week 2)**

1. **Set Up in Figma:**
   - Create a free **Figma Educational Account** using your SFU email.
   - Open a new design file for this project.

2. **Recreate Refined Sketches in Figma:**  
   - Digitally build your **three desktop layouts** and **three mobile layouts**.  
   - Apply the following **design constraints**:  
     - **Dimensions:**  
       - **Desktop:** 1920px × 1080px  
       - **Mobile:** 390px × 670px  
     - **Colours:**  
       - **Black** (0, 0, 0, RGB)  
       - **White** (255, 255, 255, RGB)  
       - **Light Gray** (211, 211, 211, RGB)  
       - **Dark Gray** (64, 64, 64, RGB)  
       - **Accent Colour:** Choose one **custom accent colour** for emphasis.  
     - **Fonts:** Use only **FiraGO, Fira Sans Light, or Open Sans**.  
   - Ensure **consistent alignment and spacing** across desktop and mobile designs.

3. **Iterate & Integrate Feedback:**  
   - Present your **digital designs** in lab for feedback.  
   - Implement **improvements** based on peer and instructor critiques.

### **Part 3: Final Implementation & Presentation (Week 3)**  

1. **Choose One Layout for Coding:**  
   - Select **either the desktop OR mobile layout** for final implementation.  
   - Ensure that:  
     - The layout follows best coding practices.  
     - The design elements translate well into HTML & CSS.  

2. **Develop the Layout in Code:**  
   - Use **semantic HTML** to structure content effectively.  
   - Apply **CSS** to style and organize the layout as per your Figma design.  
   - Ensure proper **spacing, font scaling, and information hierarchy**.  
   - If mobile is chosen, ensure it’s **optimized for small screens**.  
   - If desktop is chosen, ensure it’s **optimized for large screens**.  

3. **Deploy to GitHub Pages:**  
   - Publish your coded layout on **GitHub Pages**.  
   - Add a **Project 2 section** to your website linking to:  
     - **Your Figma file**.  
     - **Your coded implementation** (either desktop or mobile).  
   - Update **one of your AI Incident pages** from **P1** using the final layout.  

4. **Write a Brief Design Explanation:**  
   - Include a **150-word reflection** in your **Figma file** explaining:  
     - How you **established hierarchy** and readability.  
     - How the **composition guides reader attention**.  
     - How **spacing and grouping** were used to structure information.

## **Marking Rubric (100 Marks)**

| **Criteria**                      | **0%**                                                                                          | **25%**                                                                                   | **50%**                                                                                     | **75%**                                                                                       | **100%**                                                                                      | **Marks** |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| **Exploration Quality and Quantity** | Few or no layout options are provided, or they lack diversity.                                 | Some layout options are provided but do not sufficiently explore different ideas.        | Required layout options are provided, exploring somewhat different ideas.                  | Required layout options are provided, exploring a range of different ideas effectively.       | More than required layout options are provided, exploring highly diverse and innovative ideas. | 40        |
| **Clear Design & Hierarchy**      | Final designs lack clarity, and hierarchy is not established.                                   | Final designs are somewhat clear but have issues with hierarchy or layout.              | Final designs establish hierarchy but have minor issues with clarity or scale.             | Final designs are clear, with an effective hierarchy and good use of scale and layout.        | Final designs are highly polished, with exceptional hierarchy and clarity at both scales.      | 30        |
| **Final Coded Implementation**   | Code is incomplete or does not match the design.                                                  | Basic implementation, but deviates from the design significantly.                        | The implementation mostly follows the design but has some inconsistencies.                 | The implementation closely matches the design, with minor refinements needed.                 | The final implementation is clean, responsive, and accurately follows the chosen layout.       | 20        |
| **Followed Design Constraints**  | Constraints (e.g., dimensions, colours, fonts) are ignored.                                     | Some constraints are followed, but major inconsistencies exist.                         | Constraints are mostly followed, with only minor deviations.                               | Constraints are well followed, with only slight inconsistencies.                             | All constraints (colours, dimensions, fonts) are followed exactly as specified.               | 10        |
